Read the mission brief at `.agent/next-session-brief.md` and my memory at the MEMORY.md file.

Present:
1. A summary of what was completed in previous sessions
2. The next recommended mission from the Active Missions list, with its tasks
3. Any known remaining issues that should be addressed first

Then ask: "Which mission should we work on?" and list the available options.

Do NOT start any work — just present the status and options.
