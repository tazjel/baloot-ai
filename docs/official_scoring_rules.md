**Official Baloot Game Scoring Rules: Fouls and Declarations**

These rules govern the scoring penalties for fouls (errors) and clarify the fate of Declarations (Projects/Mashaari': **Serra**, **50**, **100**, **400**) in such situations.-----**Article I: Penalty for Fouls (The 'Khata' Rule)**

Upon the occurrence of a foul (error in play) by any player, the non-offending opponent is entitled to immediately invoke a special penalty scoring rule against the fouling player, causing the game to be aborted and points to be registered.**Article II: Fouls and Declarations (Projects)**

The outcome for Declarations depends entirely on whether the game was decided by a **full competition** or an **aborted play** due to a foul.**1\. Foul Committed by the Buyer (Declarer)**

If the Buyer, who owns a Declaration, commits a foul:

* The Buyer **loses the current game only**.  
* The opponent registers the base game penalty points:  
  * **26 points** for a **Sun** (No Trump) contract.  
  * **16 points** for a **Hukm** (Trump) contract.  
* **The Buyer's Declaration value is NOT registered against them** in this case. The Declaration remains the property of its owner and is disregarded for this aborted game's penalty.  
* The Declaration value is only registered against the Buyer if the loss is the result of a **full, uninterrupted competition** of play.

**2\. The Core Principle of Declarations**

A Declaration is the property of its owner. The opponent is **never** entitled to claim the value of the fouling player's Declaration, except under one condition:

* **Full Competition Required:** The Declaration can only be won by the opponent if the game proceeds to a full, valid, and uninterrupted competition, and the Buyer loses the required points in play.

\-----**Article III: Illustrative Scoring Examples (Sun Contract)**

The following examples demonstrate how Declarations and penalty points are scored. **(Assumes a base game value of 26 points in Sun contract)**.

| Scenario | Fouling Player | Scoring Outcome | Explanation |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A. Buyer Fouls** (Opponent has 100 Declaration) | Buyer (Declarer) | Opponent takes **26 points only**. | The Buyer's foul aborts the play. The opponent registers the base game value (26), but the Buyer's Declaration is safe. |
| **B. Opponent Fouls** (Opponent has 100 Declaration) | Opponent | Buyer takes **26 points ONLY**. | The Buyer registers the base game value (26). The Opponent's Declaration is safe as it was not competed for. |
| **C. Opponent Fouls** (Buyer has 100 Declaration) | Opponent | Buyer takes **26 points \+ 100 Declaration \= 126 points**. | The foul gives the Buyer the 26 points. Since the Declaration belongs to the non-fouling player (Buyer), it is registered along with the game value. |
| **D. Full Kabbout Loss** (No Foul) | Buyer (Loss) | Opponent takes **44 points only**. | In a full game loss (Kabbout), the Declaration is disregarded. Only the Kabbout value (44 points) is registered. |

\-----**Article IV: The 'Cut' (Qat') and Declaration Immunity**

A common misconception is that a player facing a likely loss (especially with a large Declaration) may commit a 'Cut' (playing a card of a different suit when able to follow) to protect their Declaration from being registered against them.

* **Refutation of the Misconception:** This notion is incorrect and irrelevant to the scoring system.  
* **The Rule:** A Declaration has no relationship to a foul (Cut or otherwise).  
  * If a player commits a **Cut** and the opponent chooses to invoke the penalty, only the base game value (**26 points**) is registered against the fouling player. **Their Declaration is NOT taken** by the opponent, regardless of its value.

\-----**Article V: The Opponent's Prerogative1. Deferral of Penalty**

The non-fouling player (the one against whom the foul was committed) has the right to defer invoking the penalty and registering the points until the very last card.

* **Purpose:** This allows the opponent to play on in the chance of achieving a **Kabbout** (44-point sweep), which yields a greater score than the base foul penalty (44 vs. 26).

**2\. Forcing Continuation (Kabbout or Full Loss)**

If the Opponent has a strong hand (is "Mukhasser" or set to win the hand), they have the right to **force the Buyer to continue play** to either:

* Complete the hand to achieve a **Kabbout** (44 points).  
* Complete the hand to achieve a **Full Loss** (36 points, the full points value of a lost Sun hand).  
  * This is an alternative to taking the 26-point foul penalty.

**Article VI: Final Notes**

This system for handling Declarations (Declarations remain with their owner if not competed for) is also applied in a **Double (Dibl)** contract, where the Declaration value remains with its owner unless a full, fair competition occurs.
