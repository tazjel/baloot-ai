Baloot Game \- Doubling (Multiplier) System Rules

The Doubling System is used to increase the stakes (points) of a hand (game). This system varies depending on whether the hand is played under "Trump" (Hokm) or "No Trump" (Sun).-----**1\. Doubling System in Trump (Hokm)**

In the Trump phase, points are counted using **Bounots (Abnat)**, regardless of whether doubling is applied.

| Doubling Level | Availability | Point Calculation (Base Score \= 16 Points) | Project Multiplier | Turban (Tarbee') Options |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Double (Dabel)** | Available from the first game. | Trump points are multiplied by 2\. Example: 16 × 2 \= **32** points. | All projects are doubled, **except for the "Baloot" project**, whose value remains constant and is not multiplied. | The player who called the Double chooses between (Open) or (Closed). |
| **Triple (Three/Thri)** | Available from the first game. | Trump points are multiplied by 3\. Example: 16 × 3 \= **48** points. | All projects are doubled, **except for the "Baloot" project**. | The player who called the Triple chooses between (Open) or (Closed). |
| **Quadruple (Four/For)** | Available from the first game. | Trump points are multiplied by 4\. Example: 16 × 4 \= **64** points. | All projects are doubled, **except for the "Baloot" project**. | The player who called the Quadruple chooses between (Open) or (Closed). |
| **Coffee (Qahwa)** | Available from the first game. | The entire hand is awarded its maximum score, which equals **152** points. | All projects are included in the scoring. | The Turban must be **Open (Mandatory)**. |

\-----**2\. Doubling System in No Trump (Sun)**

The No Trump phase **does not** use the **Bounots** point system.

| Doubling Level | Availability Condition | Point Calculation (Base Score \= 26 Points) | Project Multiplier | Target Team |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Double (Dabel)** | Only available when one team's score reaches **100** points or more. | No Trump points are multiplied by 2\. Example: 26 × 2 \= **52** points. | All projects are doubled. | Can only be requested for the **trailing** team whose score has not exceeded **100**. |

**Special Notes for No Trump (Sun)**

* The **Triple (Three)** option is **not available** in No Trump. A buying team only needs 52 points to defeat the opposing team's base score (26 x 2).  
* The No Trump phase **does not** utilize the **Bounots (Abnat)** point system (points are raw).
