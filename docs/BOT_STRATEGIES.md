## Bidding Strategies

### Ashkal Signal
- **Trigger**: When your partner calls **Ashkal** (Sun for Partner).
- **Meaning**: This is a strong signal that the partner **dislikes** the suit of the Floor Card.
- **Response**:
    - **Round 1 (Floor Match)**: Partner wants you to play the **SAME Color** but different suit.
        - *Example*: Floor is **Hearts** (Red) -> Play **Diamonds** (Red).
    - **Round 2 (Floor Mismatch)**: Partner wants you to play the **OPPOSITE Color**.
        - *Example*: Floor is **Hearts** (Red) -> Play **Spades** or **Clubs** (Black).

### Strong Project Ashkal
- **Condition**: If you hold a very strong project (4 Aces, 4 Tens, 4 Queens, etc.).
- **Action**: Call **Ashkal**.
- **Reasoning**: Secures the bid and maximizes the value of your high-scoring project (400 or 100), with the hope of receiving better playing cards from the partner's hand or the redeal/floor.

## Playing Strategies

### General
- Prioritize playing high cards in Sun if partner is winning, to save them or maximize points.
- In Hokum, do not lead Trump unless necessary or trying to draw trumps.
