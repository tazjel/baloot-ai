# Telemetry Helper

**Usage**: Paste this to the user when you need them to restart for logs.

---

Please use the `/restart` command.
After the game restarts, play a few turns.
Then, I will be able to check `logs/client_debug.log` to see exactly what happened in your browser.
This will allow me to diagnose issues without asking you for screenshots or manual logs.
